## **0.18.0** ???

In Hugo 0.18 every piece of content is a `Page`  ({{<gh 2297 >}}) and this means that every page, including the home page, can have a content file with frontmatter.

Not only is this a much simpler model to understand, it is also faster and it fixes several important issues:

* Enable proper titles for Nodes {{<gh 1051>}}
* Sitemap.xml should include nodes, as well as pages {{<gh 1303>}}
* Document homepage content workaround {{<gh 2240>}}
* Allow home page to be easily authored in markdown {{<gh 720>}}
* Minimalist website with homepage as content {{<gh 330>}}







## **0.17.0** October 7th 2016

Hugo is going global with our 0.17 release.  We put a lot of thought into how we could extend Hugo
to support multilingual websites with the most simple and elegant experience. Hugo's multilingual
capabilities rival the best web and documentation software, but Hugo's experience is unmatched.
If you have a single language website, the simple Hugo experience you already love is unchanged.
Adding additional languages to your website is simple and straightforward. Hugo has been completely
internally rewritten to be multilingual aware with translation and internationalization features
embedded throughout Hugo.

Hugo continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It's quite a challenge to consistently add
significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. {{<gh "@bep">}} has made it
his personal mission to apply the Go mantra of "Enable more. Do less" to Hugo. Hugo's consistent improvement
is a testament to his brilliance and his dedication to his craft. Hugo additionally benefits from the
performance improvements from the Go team in the Go 1.7 release.

This release represents **over 300 contributions by over 70 contributors** to
the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 2000 stars, 50 new
contributors and 20 additional themes.**

Hugo now has:

* 12,000 stars on GitHub
* 370+ contributors
* 110+ themes

{{<gh "@bep" >}} continues to lead the project with the lionshare of contributions
and reviews. A special thanks to {{<gh "@bep" >}} and {{<gh "@abourget" >}} for their
considerable work on multilingual support.

A big welcome to newcomers {{<gh "@MarkDBlackwell" >}}, {{<gh "@bogem" >}} and
{{<gh "@g3wanghc" >}} for their critical contributions.

### Highlights

**Multilingual Support:**
Hugo now supports multiple languages side-by-side. A single site can now have multiple languages rendered with
full support for translation and i18n.

**Performance:**
Hugo is faster than ever! Hugo 0.17 is not only our fastest release, it's also the most efficient.
Hugo 0.17 is **nearly twice as fast as Hugo 0.16** and uses about 10% less memory.
This means that the same site will build in nearly half the time it took with Hugo 0.16.
For the first time Hugo sites are averaging well under 1ms per rendered content.

**Docs overhaul:**
This release really focused on improving the documentation. [Gohugo.io](http://gohugo.io) is
more accurate and complete than ever.

**Support for macOS Sierra**

### New Features
* Multilingual support {{<gh 2303>}}
* Allow content expiration {{<gh 2137 >}}
* New templates functions:
  * `querify` function to generate query strings inside templates {{<gh 2257>}}
  * `htmlEscape` and `htmlUnescape` template functions {{<gh 2287>}}

## **0.16.0** June 6th 2016

Hugo 0.16 is our best and biggest release ever. The Hugo community has
outdone itself with continued performance improvements,
[beautiful themes](http://themes.gohugo.io) for all types of sites from project
sites to documentation to blogs to portfolios, and increased stability.

This release represents **over 550 contributions by over 110 contributors** to
the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 3500 stars, 90
contributors and 23 additional themes.**

This release celebrates 3 years since  {{< gh "@spf13" >}} wrote the first lines
of Hugo. During those 3 years Hugo has accomplished some major milestones
including...

* 10,000+ stars on GitHub
* 320+ contributors
* 90+ themes
* 1000s of happy websites
* Many subprojects like {{< gh "@spf13/cobra">}}, {{< gh "@spf13/viper">}} and
  {{< gh "@spf13/afero">}} which have experienced broad usage across the Go
  ecosystem.

{{< gh "@bep" >}} led the development of Hugo for the 3rd consecutive release
with nearly half of the contributions to 0.16 in addition to his considerable
contributions as lead maintainer. {{< gh "@anthonyfok" >}}, {{< gh
"@DigitalCraftsman" >}}, {{< gh "@MooreReason" >}} all made significant
contributions. A special thanks to {{< gh "@abourget " >}} for his considerable
work on multilingual support. Due to its broad impact we wanted to spend more
time testing it and it will be included in Hugo's next release.

### Highlights

**Partial Builds:** Prior to this release Hugo would always reread and rebuild
the entire site. This release introduces support for reactive site building
while watching (`hugo server`). Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes and
only re-read the changed files. Depending on the files change Hugo will
intelligently re-render only the needed portion of the site. Performance gains
depend on the operation performed and size of the site. In our testing build
times decreased anywhere from 10% to 99%.

**Template Improvements:** Template improvements continue to be a mainstay of each Hugo release. Hugo 0.16 adds support for the new `block` keyword introduced in Go 1.6 -- think base templates with default sections -- as well as many new template functions.

**Polish:** As Hugo matures releases will inevitably contain fewer huge new features. This release represents hundreds of small improvements across ever facet of Hugo which will make for a much better experience for all of our users. Worth mentioning here is the curious bug where live reloading didn't work in some editors on OS X, including the popular TextMate 2. This is now fixed. Oh, and now any error will exit with an error code, a big thing for automated deployments.

### New Features

*  Add `ByLastmod` sort function to pages. {{<gh 0xeb627ca16de6fb5e8646279edd295a8bf0f72bf1 >}}
* New templates functions:
	* `readFile` {{<gh 1551 >}}
    * `countwords` and `countrunes` {{<gh 1440>}}
    * `default` {{<gh 1943>}}
    * `hasPrefix` {{<gh 1243>}}
    * `humanize` {{<gh 1818>}}

    * `replaceRE` {{<gh 1845>}}
    * `findRE` {{<gh 2048>}}
    * `shuffle` {{<gh 1942>}}
    * `slice` {{<gh 1902>}}
    * `plainify` {{<gh 1915>}}

## **0.15.0**  November 25, 2015

The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after
the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this
is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change
we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our
many users to contribute.  This release represents over **377 contributions by
87 contributors** to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the
libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a [new theme
showcase](http://themes.gohugo.io) and participated in
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

Hugo now has:

* 6700 (+2700) stars on GitHub
* 235 (+75) contributors
* 65 (+30) themes


**Template Improvements:** This release takes Hugo to a new level of speed and
usability. Considerable work has been done adding features and performance to
the template system which now has full support of Ace, Amber and Go Templates.

**Hugo Import:** Have a Jekyll site, but dreaming of porting it to Hugo? This
release introduces a new `hugo import jekyll`command that makes this easier
than ever.

**Performance Improvements:** Just when you thought Hugo couldn't get any faster,
Hugo continues to improve in speed while adding features. Notably Hugo 0.15
introduces the ability to render and serve directly from memory resulting in
30%+ lower render times.

Huge thanks to all who participated in this release. A special thanks to
{{< gh "@bep" >}} who led the development of Hugo this release again,
{{< gh "@anthonyfok" >}},
{{< gh "@eparis" >}},
{{< gh "@tatsushid" >}} and
{{< gh "@DigitalCraftsman" >}}.


### New features
* new `hugo import jekyll` command. {{< gh 1469 >}}
* The new `Param` convenience method on `Page` and `Node` can be used to get the most specific parameter value for a given key. {{< gh 1462 >}}
* Several new information elements have been added to `Page` and `Node`:
    * `RuneCount`: The number of [runes](http://blog.golang.org/strings) in the content, excluding any whitespace. This may be a good alternative to `.WordCount`  for Japanese and other CJK languages where a word-split by spaces makes no sense.  {{< gh 1266 >}}
	* `RawContent`: Raw Markdown as a string. One use case may be of embedding remarkjs.com slides.
	* `IsHome`: tells the truth about whether you're on the home page or not.

### Improvements
* `hugo server` now builds ~30%+ faster by rendering to memory instead of disk. To get the old behavior, start the server with `--renderToDisk=true`.
* Hugo now supports dynamic reloading of the config file when watching.
* We now use a custom-built `LazyFileReader` for reading file contents, which means we don't read media files in `/content` into memory anymore -- and file reading is now performed in parallel on multicore PCs. {{< gh 1181 >}}
* Hugo is now built with `Go 1.5` which, among many other improvements, have fixed the last known data race in Hugo. {{< gh 917 >}}
* Paginator now also supports page groups. {{< gh 1274 >}}
* Markdown improvements:
    * Hugo now supports GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting for `md`-files (Blackfriday rendered markdown) and `mmark` files (MMark rendered markdown). {{< gh 362 1258 >}}
    * Several new Blackfriday options are added:
        * Option to disable Blackfriday's `Smartypants`.
        * Option for Blackfriday to open links in a new window/tab. {{< gh 1220 >}}
        * Option to disable Blackfriday's LaTeX style dashes {{< gh 1231 >}}
        * Definition lists extension support.
* `Scratch` now has built-in `map` support.
* We now fall back to `link title` for the default page sort. {{< gh 1299 >}}
* Some notable new configuration options:
	*  `IgnoreFiles` can be set with a list of Regular Expressions that matches files to be ignored during build. {{< gh 1189 >}}
	* `PreserveTaxonomyNames`, when set to `true`, will preserve what you type as the taxonomy name both in the folders created and the taxonomy `key`, but it will be normalized for the URL.  {{< gh 1180 >}}
* `hugo gen` can now generate man files, bash auto complete and markdown documentation
* Hugo will now make suggestions when a command is mistyped
* Shortcodes now have a boolean `.IsNamedParams` property. {{< gh 1597 >}}

### New Template Features
* All template engines:
	* The new `dict` function that could be used to pass maps into a template. {{< gh 1463 >}}
	* The new `pluralize` and `singularize` template funcs.
	* The new `base64Decode` and `base64Encode` template funcs.
	* The `sort` template func now accepts field/key chaining arguments and pointer values. {{< gh 1330 >}}
	* Several fixes for `slicestr` and `substr`, most importantly, they now have full `utf-8`-support. {{< gh 1190 1333 1347 >}}
	* The new `last` template function allows the user to select the last `N` items of a slice. {{< gh 1148 >}}
	* The new `after` func allows the user to select the items after the `Nth` item. {{< gh 1200 >}}
	* Add `time.Time` type support to the `where`, `ge`, `gt`, `le`, and `lt` template functions.
	* It is now possible to use constructs like `where Values ".Param.key" nil` to filter pages that doesn't have a particular parameter. {{< gh 1232 >}}
	* `getJSON`/`getCSV`: Add retry on invalid content. {{< gh 1166 >}}
	* 	The new `readDir` func lists local files. {{< gh 1204 >}}
    * The new `safeJS` function allows the embedding of content into JavaScript contexts in Go templates.
    * Get the main site RSS link from any page by accessing the `.Site.RSSLink` property. {{< gh 1566 >}}
* Ace templates:
	* Base templates now also works in themes. {{< gh 1215 >}}.
	* And now also on Windows. {{< gh 1178 >}}
* Full support for Amber templates including all template functions.
* A built-in template for Google Analytics. {{< gh 1505 >}}
* Hugo is now shipped with new built-in shortcodes: {{< gh 1576 >}}
  * `youtube` for YouTube videos
  * `vimeo` for Vimeo videos
  * `gist` for GitHub gists
  * `tweet` for Twitter Tweets
  * `speakerdeck` for Speakerdeck slides


### Bugfixes
* Fix data races in page sorting and page reversal. These operations are now also cached. {{< gh 1293 >}}
* `page.HasMenuCurrent()` and `node.HasMenuCurrent()` now work correctly in multi-level nested menus.
* Support `Fish and Chips` style section titles. Previously, this would end up as  `Fish And Chips`. Now, the first character is made toupper, but the rest are preserved as-is. {{< gh 1176 >}}
* Hugo now removes superfluous p-tags around shortcodes. {{< gh 1148 >}}

### Notices
* `hugo server` will watch by default now.
* Some fields and methods were deprecated in `0.14`. These are now removed, so the error message isn't as friendly if you still use the old values. So please change:
	*   `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to
  `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,
  `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`.

### Known Issues

Using the Hugo v0.15 32-bit Windows or ARM binary, running `hugo server` would crash or hang due to a [memory alignment issue](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG) in [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero).  The bug was discovered shortly after the v0.15.0 release and has since been [fixed](https://github.com/spf13/afero/pull/23) by {{< gh "@tpng" >}}.  If you encounter this bug, you may either compile Hugo v0.16-DEV from source, or use the following solution/workaround:

* **64-bit Windows users: Please use [hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.15/hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip)** (amd64 == x86-64).  It is only the 32-bit hugo_0.15_windows_386.zip that crashes/hangs (see {{< gh 1621 >}} and {{< gh 1628 >}}).
* **32-bit Windows and ARM users: Please run `hugo server --renderToDisk` as a workaround** until Hugo v0.16 is released (see [“hugo server” returns runtime error on armhf](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/hugo-server-returns-runtime-error-on-armhf/2293) and {{< gh 1716 >}}).

## **0.14.0** May 25, 2015

The v0.14.0 Hugo release brings of the most demanded features to Hugo. The
foundation of Hugo is stabilizing nicely and a lot of polish has been added.
We’ve expanded support for additional content types with support for AsciiDoc,
Restructured Text, HTML and Markdown. Some of these types depend on external
libraries as there does not currently exist native support in Go. We’ve tried
to make the experience as seamless as possible. Look for more improvements here
in upcoming releases.

A lot of work has been done to improve the user experience, with extra polish
to the Windows experience. Hugo errors are more helpful overall and Hugo now
can detect if it’s being run in Windows Explorer and provide additional
instructions to run it via the command prompt.

The Hugo community continues to grow. Hugo has over 4000 stars on github, 165
contributors, 35 themes and 1000s of happy users. It is now the 5th most
popular static site generator (by Stars) and has the 3rd largest contributor
community.

This release represents over **240 contributions by 36 contributors** to the main
Hugo codebase.

Big shout out to {{< gh "@bep" >}} who led the development of Hugo
this release, {{< gh "@anthonyfok" >}},
{{< gh "@eparis" >}},
{{< gh "@SchumacherFM" >}},
{{< gh "@RickCogley" >}} &
{{< gh "@mdhender" >}} for their significant contributions
and {{< gh "@tatsushid" >}} for his continuous improvements
to the templates. Also a big thanks to all the theme creators. 11 new themes
have been added since last release and the [hugoThemes repo now has previews of
all of
them](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#theme-list).

Hugo also depends on a lot of other great projects. A big thanks to all of our dependencies including:
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra),
[viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper),
[blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday),
[pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag),
[HugoThemes](https://github.com/spf13/hugothemes),
[BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml),
[goYaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v2), and the Go standard library.

## New features
* Support for all file types in content directory.
    * If dedicated file type handler isn’t found it will be copied to the destination.
* Add `AsciiDoc` support using external helpers.
* Add experimental support for [`Mmark`](https://github.com/miekg/mmark) markdown processor
* Bash autocomplete support via `genautocomplete` command
* Add section menu support for a [Section Menu for "the Lazy Blogger"]({{< relref "extras/menus.md#section-menu-for-the-lazy-blogger" >}})
* Add support for `Ace` base templates
* Adding `RelativeURLs = true` to site config will now make all the relative URLs relative to the content root.
* New template functions:
  * `getenv`
  * The string functions `substr` and `slicestr`
  * `seq`, a sequence generator very similar to its Gnu counterpart
  * `absURL` and `relURL`, both of which takes the `BaseURL` setting into account

## Improvements
* Highlighting with `Pygments` is now cached to disk -- expect a major speed boost if you use it!
* More Pygments highlighting options, including `line numbers`
* Show help information to Windows users who try to double click on `hugo.exe`.
* Add `bind` flag to `hugo server` to set the interface to which the server will bind
* Add support for `canonifyURLs` in `srcset`
* Add shortcode support for HTML (content) files
* Allow the same `shortcode` to  be used with or without inline content
* Configurable RSS output filename

## Bugfixes
* Fix panic with paginator and zero pages in result set.
* Fix crossrefs on Windows.
* Fix `eq` and `ne` template functions when used with a raw number combined with the result of `add`, `sub` etc.
* Fix paginator with uglyURLs
* Fix {{< gh 998 >}}, supporting UTF8 characters in Permalinks.

## Notices
* To get variable and function names in line with the rest of the Go community,
  a set of variable and function names has been deprecated: These will still
  work in 0.14, but will be removed in 0.15. What to do should be obvious by
  the build log; `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to
  `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,
  `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`,
  `Indexes` to `Taxonomies`.

  better error messages.

      `le`; `<`, `lt`; `in`, `not in`
    * `where` template function now also accepts dot chaining key argument
      (e.g. `"Params.foo.bar"`)
* New template functions:
    * `apply`
    * `chomp`
    * `delimit`
    * `sort`
    * `markdownify`
    * `in` and `intersect`
    * `trim`
    * `replace`
    * `dateFormat`
* Several [configurable improvements related to Markdown
  rendering](/overview/configuration/#configure-blackfriday-rendering:a66b35d20295cb764719ac8bd35837ec):
    * Configuration of footnote rendering
    * Optional support for smart angled quotes, e.g. `"Hugo"` → «Hugo»
    * Enable descriptive header IDs
* URLs in XML output is now correctly canonified ({{< gh 725 728 >}}, and part
  of {{< gh 789 >}})

### Other improvements

* Internal change to use byte buffer pool significantly lowering memory usage
  and providing measurable performance improvements overall
* Changes to docs:
    * A new [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/overview/) section is added
    * It's now searchable through Google Custom Search ({{< gh 753 >}})

          Wercker](/tutorials/automated-deployments/)
