## **0.15.0**  November 25, 2015

The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after
the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this
is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change
we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our
many users to contribute.  This release represents over **377 contributions by
87 contributors** to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the
libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a [new theme
showcase](http://themes.gohugo.io) and participated in
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

Hugo now has:

* 6700 (+2700) stars on GitHub
* 235 (+75) contributors
* 65 (+30) themes


**Template Improvements:** This release takes Hugo to a new level of speed and
usability. Considerable work has been done adding features and performance to
the template system which now has full support of Ace, Amber and Go Templates.

**Hugo Import:** Have a Jekyll site, but dreaming of porting it to Hugo? This
release introduces a new `hugo import jekyll`command that makes this easier
than ever.

**Performance Improvements:** Just when you thought Hugo couldn't get any faster,
Hugo continues to improve in speed while adding features. Notably Hugo 0.15
introduces the ability to render and serve directly from memory resulting in
30%+ lower render times.

Huge thanks to all who participated in this release. A special thanks to
{{< gh "@bep" >}} who led the development of Hugo this release again,
{{< gh "@anthonyfok" >}},
{{< gh "@eparis" >}},
{{< gh "@tatsushid" >}} and
{{< gh "@DigitalCraftsman" >}}.


### New features
* new `hugo import jekyll` command. {{< gh 1469 >}}
* The new `Param` convenience method on `Page` and `Node` can be used to get the most specific parameter value for a given key. {{< gh 1462 >}}
* Several new information elements have been added to `Page` and `Node`:
    * `RuneCount`: The number of [runes](http://blog.golang.org/strings) in the content, excluding any whitespace. This may be a good alternative to `.WordCount`  for Japanese and other CJK languages where a word-split by spaces makes no sense.  {{< gh 1266 >}}
	* `RawContent`: Raw Markdown as a string. One use case may be of embedding remarkjs.com slides.
	* `IsHome`: tells the truth about whether you're on the home page or not.

### Improvements
* `hugo server` now builds ~30%+ faster by rendering to memory instead of disk. To get the old behavior, start the server with `--renderToDisk=true`.
* Hugo now supports dynamic reloading of the config file when watching.
* We now use a custom-built `LazyFileReader` for reading file contents, which means we don't read media files in `/content` into memory anymore -- and file reading is now performed in parallel on multicore PCs. {{< gh 1181 >}}
* Hugo is now built with `Go 1.5` which, among many other improvements, have fixed the last known data race in Hugo. {{< gh 917 >}}
* Paginator now also supports page groups. {{< gh 1274 >}}
* Markdown improvements:
    * Hugo now supports GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting for `md`-files (Blackfriday rendered markdown) and `mmark` files (MMark rendered markdown). {{< gh 362 1258 >}}
    * Several new Blackfriday options are added:
        * Option to disable Blackfriday's `Smartypants`.
        * Option for Blackfriday to open links in a new window/tab. {{< gh 1220 >}}
        * Option to disable Blackfriday's LaTeX style dashes {{< gh 1231 >}}
        * Definition lists extension support.
* `Scratch` now has built-in `map` support.
* We now fall back to `link title` for the default page sort. {{< gh 1299 >}}
* Some notable new configuration options:
	*  `IgnoreFiles` can be set with a list of Regular Expressions that matches files to be ignored during build. {{< gh 1189 >}}
	* `PreserveTaxonomyNames`, when set to `true`, will preserve what you type as the taxonomy name both in the folders created and the taxonomy `key`, but it will be normalized for the URL.  {{< gh 1180 >}}
* `hugo gen` can now generate man files, bash auto complete and markdown documentation
* Hugo will now make suggestions when a command is mistyped
* Shortcodes now have a boolean `.IsNamedParams` property. {{< gh 1597 >}}

### New Template Features
* All template engines:
	* The new `dict` function that could be used to pass maps into a template. {{< gh 1463 >}}
	* The new `pluralize` and `singularize` template funcs.
	* The new `base64Decode` and `base64Encode` template funcs.
	* The `sort` template func now accepts field/key chaining arguments and pointer values. {{< gh 1330 >}}
	* Several fixes for `slicestr` and `substr`, most importantly, they now have full `utf-8`-support. {{< gh 1190 1333 1347 >}}
	* The new `last` template function allows the user to select the last `N` items of a slice. {{< gh 1148 >}}
	* The new `after` func allows the user to select the items after the `Nth` item. {{< gh 1200 >}}
	* Add `time.Time` type support to the `where`, `ge`, `gt`, `le`, and `lt` template functions.
	* It is now possible to use constructs like `where Values ".Param.key" nil` to filter pages that doesn't have a particular parameter. {{< gh 1232 >}}
	* `getJSON`/`getCSV`: Add retry on invalid content. {{< gh 1166 >}}
	* 	The new `readDir` func lists local files. {{< gh 1204 >}}
    * The new `safeJS` function allows the embedding of content into JavaScript contexts in Go templates.
    * Get the main site RSS link from any page by accessing the `.Site.RSSLink` property. {{< gh 1566 >}}
* Ace templates:
	* Base templates now also works in themes. {{< gh 1215 >}}.
	* And now also on Windows. {{< gh 1178 >}}
* Full support for Amber templates including all template functions.
* A built-in template for Google Analytics. {{< gh 1505 >}}
* Hugo is now shipped with new built-in shortcodes: {{< gh 1576 >}}
  * `youtube` for YouTube videos
  * `vimeo` for Vimeo videos
  * `gist` for GitHub gists
  * `tweet` for Twitter Tweets
  * `speakerdeck` for Speakerdeck slides


### Bugfixes
* Fix data races in page sorting and page reversal. These operations are now also cached. {{< gh 1293 >}}
* `page.HasMenuCurrent()` and `node.HasMenuCurrent()` now work correctly in multi-level nested menus.
* Support `Fish and Chips` style section titles. Previously, this would end up as  `Fish And Chips`. Now, the first character is made toupper, but the rest are preserved as-is. {{< gh 1176 >}}
* Hugo now removes superfluous p-tags around shortcodes. {{< gh 1148 >}}

### Notices
* `hugo server` will watch by default now.
* Some fields and methods were deprecated in `0.14`. These are now removed, so the error message isn't as friendly if you still use the old values. So please change:
	*   `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to
  `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,
  `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`.

### Known Issues

Using the Hugo v0.15 32-bit Windows or ARM binary, running `hugo server` would crash or hang due to a [memory alignment issue](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG) in [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero).  The bug was discovered shortly after the v0.15.0 release and has since been [fixed](https://github.com/spf13/afero/pull/23) by {{< gh "@tpng" >}}.  If you encounter this bug, you may either compile Hugo v0.16-DEV from source, or use the following solution/workaround:

* **64-bit Windows users: Please use [hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.15/hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip)** (amd64 == x86-64).  It is only the 32-bit hugo_0.15_windows_386.zip that crashes/hangs (see {{< gh 1621 >}} and {{< gh 1628 >}}).
* **32-bit Windows and ARM users: Please run `hugo server --renderToDisk` as a workaround** until Hugo v0.16 is released (see [“hugo server” returns runtime error on armhf](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/hugo-server-returns-runtime-error-on-armhf/2293) and {{< gh 1716 >}}).

## **0.14.0** May 25, 2015

The v0.14.0 Hugo release brings of the most demanded features to Hugo. The
foundation of Hugo is stabilizing nicely and a lot of polish has been added.
We’ve expanded support for additional content types with support for AsciiDoc,
Restructured Text, HTML and Markdown. Some of these types depend on external
libraries as there does not currently exist native support in Go. We’ve tried
to make the experience as seamless as possible. Look for more improvements here
in upcoming releases.

A lot of work has been done to improve the user experience, with extra polish
to the Windows experience. Hugo errors are more helpful overall and Hugo now
can detect if it’s being run in Windows Explorer and provide additional
instructions to run it via the command prompt.

The Hugo community continues to grow. Hugo has over 4000 stars on github, 165
contributors, 35 themes and 1000s of happy users. It is now the 5th most
popular static site generator (by Stars) and has the 3rd largest contributor
community.

This release represents over **240 contributions by 36 contributors** to the main
Hugo codebase.

Big shout out to {{< gh "@bep" >}} who led the development of Hugo
this release, {{< gh "@anthonyfok" >}},
{{< gh "@eparis" >}},
{{< gh "@SchumacherFM" >}},
{{< gh "@RickCogley" >}} &
{{< gh "@mdhender" >}} for their significant contributions
and {{< gh "@tatsushid" >}} for his continuous improvements
to the templates. Also a big thanks to all the theme creators. 11 new themes
have been added since last release and the [hugoThemes repo now has previews of
all of
them](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#theme-list).

Hugo also depends on a lot of other great projects. A big thanks to all of our dependencies including:
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra),
[viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper),
[blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday),
[pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag),
[HugoThemes](https://github.com/spf13/hugothemes),
[BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml),
[goYaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v2), and the Go standard library.

## New features
* Support for all file types in content directory.
    * If dedicated file type handler isn’t found it will be copied to the destination.
* Add `AsciiDoc` support using external helpers.
* Add experimental support for [`Mmark`](https://github.com/miekg/mmark) markdown processor
* Bash autocomplete support via `genautocomplete` command
* Add section menu support for a [Section Menu for "the Lazy Blogger"]({{< relref "extras/menus.md#section-menu-for-the-lazy-blogger" >}})
* Add support for `Ace` base templates
* Adding `RelativeURLs = true` to site config will now make all the relative URLs relative to the content root.
* New template functions:
  * `getenv`
  * The string functions `substr` and `slicestr`
  * `seq`, a sequence generator very similar to its Gnu counterpart
  * `absURL` and `relURL`, both of which takes the `BaseURL` setting into account

## Improvements

* More Pygments highlighting options, including `line numbers`
* Show help information to Windows users who try to double click on `hugo.exe`.
* Add `bind` flag to `hugo server` to set the interface to which the server will bind
* Add support for `canonifyurls` in `srcset`

## Bugfixes

* Fix `eq` and `ne` template functions when used with a raw number combined with the result of `add`, `sub` etc.
* Fix paginator with uglyurls
* Fix {{< gh 998 >}}, supporting UTF8 characters in Permalinks.

## Notices
* To get variable and function names in line with the rest of the Go community,
  a set of variable and function names has been deprecated: These will still
  work in 0.14, but will be removed in 0.15. What to do should be obvious by
  the build log; `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to
  `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,
  `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`,
  `Indexes` to `Taxonomies`.

## **0.13.0** Feb 21, 2015

The v0.13.0 release is the largest Hugo release to date. The release introduced
some long sought after features (pagination, sequencing, data loading, tons of
template improvements) as well as major internal improvements. In addition to
