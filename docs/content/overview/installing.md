Hugo is written in Go with support for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OSX.

The latest release can be found at [hugo releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases).
We currently build for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OS X for x64
and 386 architectures. 

## Installing Hugo (binary)

Installation is very easy. Simply download the appropriate version for your
platform from [hugo releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases).
Once downloaded it can be run from anywhere. You don't need to install
it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
where you don't have a privileged account.

Ideally you should install it somewhere in your path for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` 
is the most probable location.

### Installing pygments (optional)

The Hugo executable has one *optional* external dependency for source code highlighting (pygments).

If you want to have source code highlighting using the [highlight shortcode](/extras/highlighting)
you need to install the python-based pygments program. The procedure is outlined on the [pygments home page](http://pygments.org).

## Upgrading Hugo

Upgrading hugo is as easy as downloading and replacing the executable youâ€™ve
placed in your path.
