Hugo uses the excellent golang html/template library for its template engine.
It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of
logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to
create a good static website.

This is a brief primer on using go templates. The [golang
docs](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) provide more details.
