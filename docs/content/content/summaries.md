Hugo generates summaries of content for easily showing snippets in summary views. The summary view snippets are automatically generated by Hugo. Where a piece of content's summary is split depends on whether the split is Hugo defined or use defined.

Content summaries provide links to the original content, usually in the form of a `Read More` link.

## Automatic summary split

By default, Hugo automatically splits content after 70 words, with the content prior to the split being used for the content summary. This way you don't have to worry about content summary unless you want to customize it; the summary is automatically created for you, and available to be used by Hugo, without any additional work on your part.

## User defined summary split

Hugo also provides an easy way to customize a piece of content's split with its summary content divider:  <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code>. If the summary content divider exists within a piece of content, Hugo will split the content at that point, instead of the default 70 words. The content prior to the summary content provider will be used as that content's summary. The summary content provider, <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code>, will be elided from the rendered content.

The summary content divider only applies to the content that it appears in.
