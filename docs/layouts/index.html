                <br> 
              </h2>
              <p>Written in GoLang for speed, Hugo is significantly faster than most
              other static site generators.
              A typical website of moderate size can be
              rendered in a fraction of a second. A good rule of thumb is that Hugo
              takes around 1 millisecond for each piece of content.<br>
              It's so fast that it will render the site in 
              less time than it takes to switch to your browser and reload.</p>

              <h2>Flexible</h2>
              <p>Hugo is made to be very flexible. Define your own content types. Define
              your own indexes. Build your own templates, shortcodes and more.
              It is written to work well with any
              kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.</p>

              <h2>Fun</h2>
              <p>Hugo runs everywhere. Sites generated with Hugo work on every web 
              server without any special configuration. Hugo
              removes all the cruft of building a site allowing you to 
              focus on writing great content.</p>
