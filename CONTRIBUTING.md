## Code Contribution Guideline

We welcome your contributions. 
To make the process as seamless as possible, we ask for the following:

* Go ahead and fork the project and make your changes. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes.
* When you’re ready to create a pull request, be sure to:
     * Sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/spf13/hugo)
     * Have test cases for the new code. If you have questions about how to do it, please ask in your pull request.
     * Run `go fmt`
     * Squash your commits into a single commit. `git rebase -i`. It’s okay to force update your pull request.
     * **Write a good commit message.** This [blog article](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good resource for learning how to write good commit messages, the most important part being that each commit message should have a title/subject in imperative mood starting with a capital letter and no trailing period: *"Return error on wrong use of the Paginator"*, **NOT** *"returning some error."* Also, if your commit references one or more GitHub issues, always end your commit message body with *See #1234* or *Fixes #1234*. Replace *1234* with the GitHub issue ID. The last example will close the issue when the commit is merged into *master*. Sometimes it makes sense to prefix the commit message with the packagename (or docs folder) all lowercased ending with a colon. That is fine, but the rest of the rules above apply. So it is "tpl: Add emojify template func", not "tpl: add emojify template func.", and "docs: Document emoji", not "doc: document emoji."
     * Make sure `go test ./...` passes, and `go build` completes. Our [Travis CI loop](https://travis-ci.org/spf13/hugo) (Linux and OS&nbsp;X) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spf13/hugo/branch/master) (Windows) will catch most things that are missing.
